## Bootcamp pre work study guide for students

My motivation for this project was to advance my skills in knowing how to code. I built this project to further my knowledge and learn about how to create web designs. I learned alot about CSS and I did get stuck on the for loops in Javascript but overall I believed I learned some how to make those loops and arrays.
